The code snippets I provided aren’t automatically saved in a notepad or any file on your computer. You’ll need to manually copy and paste them into the appropriate files in your project.

Here’s a quick guide on how to do that:

Open a Text Editor:
You can use any text editor like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
Create and Save Files:
For the front-end (React):
Create a new file named LoginPage.js and paste the LoginPage code into it.
Create another file named Dashboard.js and paste the Dashboard code into it.
Open App.js in your React project and replace its content with the provided code.
For the back-end (Node.js with Express):
Create a new file named server.js and paste the server code into it.
Save the Files:
Save each file in the appropriate directory of your project.
